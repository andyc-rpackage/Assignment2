# Assignment2

The goal of Assignment2 is to combine skills of creating, writing, documenting and testing an R package with releasing that package on GitHub. This file also includes the Travis badge as a proof of building success without errors or warnings. Only one note is left related to no visible bindings for global variable such as STATE,MONTH, etc 

## Installation

You can install Assignment2 from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Assignment2/andyc-rpackage")
```
